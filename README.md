# turn-based-game-server
The turn based game server is a simple Vapor/Swift based server for handling turn based games.

# Installation


# API

The API to the server is a normal HTTP based JSON thing. The API allows players to do all the operations
related to registering themselves, creating and joining games as well as submitting turns.

# Admin API

A simple HTTP/JSON based API exists for doing various administrative tasks too. Currently it operates as read-only, ie.
data can only be viewed and nothing can be changed.
